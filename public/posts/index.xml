      <description>This is a pattern I&amp;rsquo;ve used quite a bit at work and is pretty useful for unit testing.&#xA;A scenario Let&amp;rsquo;s suppose we have a service Service which provides various bits of functionality.

      <description>I got a Raspberry Pi years ago after finishing GCSE Computing at school and could never quite figure out what to do with it.&#xA;Recently though I found out about a project called Navidrome:&#xA;Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. It gives you freedom to listen to your music collection from any browser or mobile device. It’s like your personal Spotify!&#xA;(from the Github README) It’s compatible with the Subsonic API which is accessible from a number of music player client across mobile, desktop and web platforms.</description>
